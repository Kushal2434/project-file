    <h1>Global Heatwave Breaks Temperature Records</h1>
    <p class="meta">By Global Editor | July 19, 2025</p>
    <div class="article-body">
      <p>A powerful heatwave is gripping the planet, breaking temperature records and putting millions at risk.
<br><br>
China saw highs over 46°C, with electricity demand hitting all-time records as people turned to cooling systems.
<br><br>
Europe had its hottest June ever, leading to 2,300+ heat-related deaths, especially in Spain, the UK, and Portugal.
<br><br>
India and Pakistan endured temperatures up to 48°C, with hundreds of fatalities reported.
<br><br>
Even Iceland and Greenland faced unusually high temperatures, up to 13°C above normal.
<br><br>
Scientists say this extreme heat is driven by climate change, with rising greenhouse gas levels intensifying and prolonging heatwaves. Authorities worldwide are implementing emergency responses like cooling shelters, school closures, and energy warnings, as experts warn that such heat could become the “new normal” if emissions aren't cut.</p>

     <h1>US Elections 2026: Campaigns Begin Early</h1>
    <p class="meta">By Ramesh Thapa | July 19, 2025</p>
    <div class="article-body">
      <p> Campaigning for the 2026 U.S. midterm elections is already in full swing, more than a year ahead of Election Day. Candidates from both major parties are launching bids earlier than ever, aiming to build momentum, raise funds, and secure endorsements well before traditional timelines.
<br><br>
🔥 Key Senate Races
Kentucky: With Senator Mitch McConnell retiring, GOP figures like Andy Barr and Daniel Cameron are eyeing the seat.

Arkansas: Democrat Hallie Shoffner will challenge Republican Tom Cotton, campaigning on rural and economic issues.

New Hampshire: Governor Chris Sununu is considering a Senate run, with support from Donald Trump.

Illinois: A crowded Democratic field is emerging as Senator Dick Durbin retires, with candidates like Raja Krishnamoorthi and Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton already active.
<br><br>
🗳️ Gubernatorial Contests
South Carolina: Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette has launched her campaign for governor, closely aligning with Trump’s agenda.
<br><br>
Michigan: Several Republicans, including former House Speaker Tom Leonard, are expected to run, while Democrats like Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson prepare for tough races.
<br><br>
💰 Campaign Trends
Experts predict record-breaking ad spending, exceeding $12 billion. Digital outreach, creative ads, and early fundraising are becoming critical to gaining an edge in competitive races.
<br><br>
📅 What’s Next
Primaries begin in early 2026, with the general election scheduled for November 3, 2026. All 435 House seats, about 35 Senate seats, and numerous governorships will be contested.
<br><br>
The early start to this election cycle reflects shifting political strategies and the growing intensity of American electoral politics.</p>

     <h1>Japan Develops Earthquake-Resistant Floating Cities</h1>
    <p class="meta">By Ramesh Thapa | July 19, 2025</p>
    <div class="article-body">
     <p>Japan is making headlines with its innovative approach to earthquake resilience—combining real-world technology and futuristic concepts to prepare for seismic and climate threats.
<br><br>
🏠 Floating Homes with Air Danshin Technology
Japanese company Air Danshin Systems has successfully developed earthquake-resistant homes that float during seismic activity. When sensors detect tremors, the system instantly inflates airbags beneath the home, lifting it a few centimeters off the ground. This prevents the building from shaking and significantly reduces damage.
<br><br>
Over 90 homes in Japan have already been fitted with this technology.
<br><br>
It costs around ¥3 million (≈$37,000)—much cheaper than traditional seismic isolation systems.
<br><br>
Shake-table tests have shown the homes remain almost completely stable during earthquakes.
<br><br>
🌊 Vision of Floating Cities
On a grander scale, Japanese design firm N-Ark has proposed a futuristic floating city called Dogen City. Designed to house 10,000 residents, the city would include hospitals, schools, green energy systems, and even space-launch facilities—all built to withstand sea-level rise, tsunamis, and natural disasters.
<br><br>
However, Dogen City remains conceptual—with no confirmed start date or budget yet in place.
<br><br>
⚙️ Emerging Tech: Magnetic Earthquake Dampers
Japanese researchers are also exploring maglev-based dampers that use magnetic levitation to reduce building sway during earthquakes. While promising, this technology is still in the research stage and faces engineering and cost challenges.
<br><br>
✅ Why It Matters
Japan is taking both practical and visionary steps to protect its population from disasters. While floating cities are still on the drawing board, air-lift home foundations are already saving lives, offering new hope for quake-prone areas worldwide.
